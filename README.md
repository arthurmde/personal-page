# Personal Page NanocThis project has the code used to generate personal pages with [Nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/), a static-site generator.The main object of this repository is to create the basic structure that can be used tocreate personal pages. Thus, this source code provides some structures and features that you can use to createyour own personal web-site:* The basic layout already includes [**bootstrap**](http://getbootstrap.com/), so you can have a responsive websiteand use the existing **bootstrap** features* Since we use **Nanoc**, you can:  * have REST-like URLs. You can find some sample pages in the content folder (i.e: the file content/projects.html  will generate a page in /projects/ URL.  * have helpful **ruby code** in .erb files which will be compiled to html files afterwards.  * define your basic layout in a separeted file from content files.* You can customize the design of your page by overwireting the default css in content/style.css Checkout some examples here: * **http://www.ime.usp.br/~esposte/**## Setup1. Install Ruby 2.2.0. You can use [rvm](https://rvm.io) for this.2. Install nanoc: `gem install nanoc`.   * **Note**: if gem install command fails with permission error, try it with **sudo**.3. Check if nanoc was properly installed: `nanoc --version`4. Install a local server: `gem install adsf`.  * **Note**: if gem install command fails with permission error, try it with **sudo**.## Compile the siteTo compile the site run: `nanoc`. Nanoc will create the complete HTML files in the output folder with plain HTML.Now you can start a web server by running `nanoc view`. Open a web browser and you should be able to see the site.
